\### Who am I

I began my academic journey in Animal Science at China Agricultural University and continued with a Masterâ€™s and PhD in Animal Nutrition at Wageningen University. During my PhD, which focused on developing an in vitro model of protein fermentation, I developed a strong interest in data analysis.

### My work at Bovi-Analytics

I joined Bovi-Analytics as a postdoctoral researcher, where my main responsibilities include project management and data management for the project *Accurate Gas Emissions Measures from Cattle with the GreenFeed System*. This project aims to develop international standards and guidelines for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from beef and dairy cattle using the GreenFeed system across various production scenarios.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
