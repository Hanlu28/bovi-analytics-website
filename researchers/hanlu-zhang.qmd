\### Who am I

I began my academic journey in Animal Science at China Agricultural University and continued with a Masterâ€™s and PhD in Animal Nutrition at Wageningen University. During my PhD, which focused on developing an in vitro model of protein fermentation, I developed a strong interest in data analysis.

### My work at Bovi-Analytics

I joined Bovi-Analytics as a postdoctoral researcher, where my main responsibilities include project management and data management for the project *Accurate Gas Emissions Measures from Cattle with the GreenFeed System*. This project aims to develop international standards and guidelines for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from beef and dairy cattle using the GreenFeed system across various production scenarios.
